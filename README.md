# Airway tree segmentation from CT

This code performs an airway tree segmentation from a CT image, then using graph algorithms it
labels and colours the branches based on their generation.

For certain parts of my algorithm, I've used the following codes:

For handling NIfTI files, the following toolbox is necessary:

To use this algorithm, you have to run the 'AirwayTreeSegmentation.m' file. It requires a CT image as an input, in '.nii.gz' or '.nii' format.
The results of each step are saved in an appropriately named '.nii' file.
